# Hooks

React PaperCSS includes a small set of built-in hooks to help with component development and usage.

## Usage

There are two ways to import hooks: you can import from `react-papercss-design/hooks`, or directly from `react-papercss-design`.

```jsx | pure
// Direct import
import { useTheme, useLocale } from 'react-papercss-design';

// Import from hooks
import { useTheme, useLocale } from 'react-papercss-design/hooks';
```
