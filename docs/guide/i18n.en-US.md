# Internationalization

English is supported by default. If you need to use other languages, you can refer to the following solution.

## ConfigProvider

You can use the `locale` property of `ConfigProvider` to set the global language environment.

```tsx | pure
import { ConfigProvider } from 'react-papercss-design';

return (
  <ConfigProvider locale="zh-CN">
    <App />
  </ConfigProvider>
);
```

Currently supported languages:

| Language | locale value |
| -------- | ------------ |
| English  | `en-US`      |
| Chinese  | `zh-CN`      |

For more usage, please refer to: [ConfigProvider](../../src/ConfigProvider/index.en-US.md)
